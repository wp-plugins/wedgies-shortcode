Wedgies are polls you can embed on your Wordpress page. Engage your audience by asking them a question via Wedgies.

== Description ==

The Wedgies social polling WordPress plug-in allows you to easily add social polls to your Wordpress site, post, or page.

Social polls are a great way to engage site visitors and are proven as one of the best ways to create engagement.

On average, 1 in 5 readers will vote on a poll, 1 in 6 voters will share their poll results to social media, which creates 20% more site traffic for the publisher of the poll.

This plugin makes it easy to embed a [wedgie](http://wedgies.com) into the content of a post or page using a URL.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Wedgies Social Polling plugin.
2. Activate it through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Edit the post or page where you'd like to insert an embedded wedgie.
4. You can embed a wedgie one of two ways:
    1. Paste the url of a wedgie in the post: http://www.wedgies.com/question/52dc9862da36f6020000000c
    2. Paste the short code `[wedgie id="WEDGIE-ID-HERE"]` where you'd like the embedded wedgie to appear. You can get the ID of your wedgie from the URL of the page when you create a wedgie.
