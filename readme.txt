Wedgies are polls you can embed on your Wordpress page. Engage your audience by asking them a question via Wedgies.

== Description ==

Polls are one of the best ways to engage your website audience.  Wedgies are well designed and responsive polling widgets that look great anywhere on your website, allow you to engage your visitors with questions, and encourage them to share their votes back out to social media.

This plugin makes it easy to embed a [wedgie](http://wedgies.com) into the content of a post or page using a URL.

`http://www.wedgies.com/question/5164b8cc9688ec020000000a`

== Installation ==

1. Install the Wedgies Shortcode plugin.
2. Activate it through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Edit the post or page where you'd like to insert an embedded wedgie.
4. You can embed a wedgie one of two ways:
    1. Paste the url of a wedgie in the post: http://www.wedgies.com/question/52dc9862da36f6020000000c
    2. Paste the short code `[wedgie id="WEDGIE-ID-HERE"]` where you'd like the embedded wedgie to appear. You can get the ID of your wedgie from the URL of the page when you create a wedgie. For instance, the ID of [this wedgie](http://www.wedgies.com/results/question/52dc9862da36f6020000000c) is "52dc9862da36f6020000000c".
